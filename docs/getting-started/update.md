# Update Intel Aero software

The Intel Aero Compute Board and the RTF Kit comes already flashed from factory
and ready to use. The version may vary and it's recommended for developers to
update to the last available version.

There are 4 main components that may need to be updated:
Operating System, BIOS, FPGA, Flight Controller (aerofc).

## Check current version

In order to know what needs to be updated you may check what's already
currently installed on your board. Connect to the board via WiFi or USB
and use the following command on the terminal:

``` console
# aero-get-version.py
BIOS_VERSION = Aero-01.00.12_Prod
OS_VERSION = v1.4
AIRMAP_VERSION = 1.8
FPGA_VERSION = 0xc0
```

This should show the 3 important versions: OS, BIOS and FPGA. The flight
controller currently doesn't report its version this way.

## Download

The last software version can be downloaded from
[Intel's Download Center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/26932/Intel-Aero-Platform-for-UAVs-Installation-Files).
You will need to download the "Operating system image" and the "Capsule/BIOS"
from that page.

!!! Tip
    The Operating system image is updated much more frequently than the BIOS.
    If you already have the last BIOS flashed you don't need to download and
    flash it again. See [Check current version](#check-current-version) for instructions on how to check version
    currently installed.

As of this writting the OS Image is at version 1.4 and the BIOS at version
1.00.12. After downloading it's advised to check if the download was successful
by checking its md5sum. It must match the md5sum published on the Download Center.

## Check md5sum

### Linux and macOS

Open a terminal and execute the following command below. The md5sum can be seen
in the line following it.

``` console
$ md5sum ~/Downloads/intel-aero-image-1.4.iso
9a1706addd08eb8bea3a4e6dbc58b724 /home/<user>/Downloads/intel-aero-image-1.4.iso
```

The command above assumes the download has been done to your Downloads directory,
which is usually the default location but may vary across distros.

### Windows

You will need to download and install [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/).
This software can also be used later below if you are following the Windows-specific
instructions. See picture below that contains the "MD5 hash" for an earlier
version of the OS image.

## Write OS image to USB drive

The method to write the image to the USB drive will depend on what Operating
System you are using. Below you can find options that work on each of Linux,
Windows and macOS.

### Linux, Windows and macOS

Follow these steps:

- Download and install [Etcher](https://etcher.io/). follow specific instructions
  on their website for installation
- Launch Etcher
- Select the downloaded OS image file
- Select the USB drive where it will be written to
- Click on "Flash" button

Wait for the image to be written and verified.

### Linux and macOS *(alternative)*

It's possible to use the command line to write the image to a USB drive as
below. Note that the letter *X* below should be replaced by the letter of
your USB drive (be careful not to use the wrong drive since it can overwrite
your main disk).

``` sh
dd if=~/Downloads/intel-aero-image-1.4.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```

### Windows *(alternative)*

If you are using this method, you need to use Win32 Disk Imager
as detailed in [Check md5sum](#windows) section. After checking the
download is correct proceed with the following steps:

- Select your USB drive
- Click on "Write" button

## Flash OS image

In order to flash a new OS image you can connect to it either via
WiFi or USB. Since the USB port will be needed to connect the USB drive
it's recommended to use WiFi though. Follow the instructions on [XXXXX](#) to
connect establish the network connection and connect via ssh. The commands
below assume you are already connected to the Compute Board.

Based on the version you **currently** have installed on the Compute Board the
method varies since recent versions are always improving the process.

### v1.2 (or greater) via WiFi

Just one command is needed:

``` console
# aero-reboot-update.py

```
This will verify you have a new OS image on the USB drive and reboot in update
mode.

### v1.2 (or greater) via USB

If you are connected via USB you have to bypass the check done by the command
on the previous section since the USB is being used for usb-ethernet connection:

``` console
# aero-reboot-update.py -f
```

After seeing the message that the system is rebooting, rapidly connect the USB
drive so the system can reboot into it.

### Before v1.2

Before version 1.2 the command `aero-reboot-update.py` used on the previous
sections didn't exist. You will need to manually access the USB drive to
execute that command directly from the new OS image.

``` console
# mkdir -p /tmp/{iso,newroot}
# mount -o ro /dev/sda1 /tmp/iso
# mount -o loop,ro /tmp/iso/rootfs.img /tmp/newroot
# /tmp/newroot/usr/sbin/aero-reboot-update.py
```

Just like on [v1.2 (or greater) via USB](#v12-or-greater-via-usb) you should
pass the `-f` flag to the last command if you are connected via USB.

### Status progress

The updated process gives feedback to the user in some forms:

1. If you have an HDMI screen connected, you will see the progress of the
   update as text on it
1. Internal RGB LED on Compute Board will blink according to the different
   phases:

    1. When the board is turned on the LED is green
    1. Before rebooting the RGB LED will become yellow: this means the board
       started the reboot progress. It takes around 20 seconds for this
       command to take effect and thus change from yellow to green again.
       If the BIOS version is older than 1.00.12, the reboot command may get
       stuck. You can safely remove power and power it on again if that happens:
       it will proceed with the update process
    1. When board is rebooted the RGB LED becomes green again
    1. During the update process the RGB LED will blink red once a second (1Hz).
       The time taken by the update process may vary, but should take around 3
       minutes.
    1. When the Compute Board is updated the RGB LED will blink fast at 10Hz for
       5 seconds and reboot. After that the update process is done and you should
       be greeted with the new version

1. On the RTF kit there are additional blue LEDs next to the power button. They
   will follow the same blink pattern as above with the exception that they don't
   change color

!!! Tip
    On the RTF kit it may be difficult to see the internal RGB LED. You can look
    to the hole through each the FAN cable is passing in order to
    check it's. See the image below for reference. You can also use your hand
    putting it near to the hole to reflect the light and monitor the progress.

## BIOS

The BIOS update works by installing the downloaded package `rpm` package. This
will install the update file that will be used on next boot to update it. You
need to follow these steps:

1. Copy the file to Aero Compute Board: you may use `scp` or `rsync`. Example:

``` console
$ scp ~/Downloads/capsule-01.00.12-r0.core2_64.rpm intel-aero.local:
```

1. Install and reboot

``` console
# dnf install capsule-01.00.12-r0.core2_64.rpm
# reboot
```

During the next boot the BIOS will detect the update and flash the new version.
If you have HDMI output connected you can see the update progress. After
logging in again, check the current version [as above](#check-current-version)
to make sure everything worked.

## FPGA

The OS image comes with the recommended versions of the FPGA firmware, but during
the install process it doesn't flash it automatically since the user may choose
what version to use depending on his needs and also can modify and have his own
firmware: the [FPGA source](https://github.com/intel-aero/intel-aero-fpga)
is open source too. Check the available versions of the fpga under `/etc/fpga/`:

- `aero-rtf.jam`: this is for use with RTF kit during normal operation
- `aero-rtf-recovery.jam`: this is for use with the RTF kit under special
  circunstances: it allows the Compute Board to instruct the Flight Controller
  to stop on bootloader so we can flash new versions of the firmware even if
  the previous version stopped responding due to a bad update
- `aero-compute-board.jam`: this should be selected if using only the Compute
  Board and not the Flight Controller. Note that the labels that accompany
  the Compute Board have no meaning. Check the official documentation for
  what each pin is connected to.

You can flash the FPGA with the command below in which `<firmware>` is one of
the firmwares above.

``` console
# jam -aprogram /etc/fpga/<firmware>.jam
```

## Flight Controller

This only applies to the RTF kit since the Compute Board doesn't come with
the flight controller which is called **aerofc**. The RTF kit comes
pre-flashed and calibrated with PX4, but it's recommended to update to the
same version that comes in the OS image to get the latest improvements.

The current version of OS image comes with both PX4 and ArduPilot firmwares
and the user can choose which one he prefers. They are located in `/etc/aerofc/`.
Commands below illustrate how to flash each of them:

PX4:
``` console
# aerofc-update.sh /etc/aerofc/px4/nuttx-aerofc-v1-default.px4
```

ArduPilot:
``` console
# aerofc-update.sh /etc/aerofc/ardupilot/arducopter-aerofc-v1.px4
```

After this command the flight controller (not the Compute Board) is
automatically rebooted with the new firmware.

Flight stack developers may want to flash the current version being developed
rather than the stable version that comes with the OS image. For that it's
recommended to follow the steps from each of them: [PX4](https://dev.px4.io/en/flight_controller/intel_aero.html)
and [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-intel-aero-rtf.html).

## Updating packages

The release 1.5 enabled by default the possibility of updates per package, featuring `dnf` as the package management tool.

The main purpose of the official package repository is to make updates of key components available in a faster pace than the OS release cycles. Note that it **does not** intend to be a fully featured repository as the ones offered by standard Linux distributions - at first, it provides the rpms of packages that are in the .iso, but eventually new ones can be included - For suggestions about packages addition/update/modification,  please open an issue at https://github.com/intel-aero/meta-intel-aero/issues .

First step, required only once: retrieve the public

``` console
# rpm --import https://download.01.org/aero/repo/intel-aero-key.pub
```

In order to execute a check for updates, run:

``` console
# dnf update
```

If there are new versions for packages, dnf will list them and ask for confirmation.

To install a package from the official repository:

``` console
# dnf install package-name
```

To remove a package:

``` console
# dnf remove package-name
```

`dnf` can also be used to install local, custom rpms, for example:

``` console
# dnf install --nogpgcheck custom-package.rpm
```

By default, `dnf` will check package signature (the official repo publishes them signed). The `--nogpgcheck` parameter above tells dnf to not check the signature of the local custom package. It is useful for development, however not recommended for packages from public repositories.

For a comprehensive documentation about all dnf commands, please check the [upstream documentation](http://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_ref.html)
