# Introduction

Do you know how power lines are checked? They send a customized helicopter with a highly trained crew to take photos. It’s slow, expensive and dangerous. The next step is of course to use a remotely controlled drone to take the pictures. It’s still slow and not scalable to the full size of the power line network.

That’s why we need autonomous drones, able to fly but also avoid collisions and analyze the situation as they go. Autonomous Drone Engineers will need to master a wide range of skills, from computer vision basics, embedded development and drone hardware design. Go through the training material below to understand,

* How to connect to the flight controller
* What's the general software architecture
* How to use yocto or ubuntu or the linux OS of choice in a container
