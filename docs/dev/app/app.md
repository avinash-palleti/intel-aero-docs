# Introduction

Do you know how power lines are checked? They send a customized helicopter with
a highly trained crew to take photos. It’s slow, expensive and dangerous. The
next step is of course to use a remotely controlled drone to take the pictures.
It’s still slow and not scalable to the full size of the power line network.

That’s why we need autonomous drones, able to fly but also avoid collisions and
analyze the situation as they go. Autonomous drones are more powerful with
capability of loading custom user applications.There are few development
libraries which helps user to develop companion applications. This section
covers most of them with sample code using those libraries.

Some of the development libraries might not be available by default in
Intel-Aero image, for which there is need of active internet connection to
download the same. Follow steps from

to connect to internet.
